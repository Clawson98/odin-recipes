            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li> <br>

            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic 
                in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li><br>

            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.<br> 
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.<br>
                 Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li><br>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. <br>
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li><br>

            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons <br>
                 parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li><br>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li><br>

            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. <br>
                 Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. <br>
                 Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. <br>
                 Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
                 Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li><br>

            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. <br>
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray
                or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li><br>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. <br>
                Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li><br>

            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
